FLASHRD BUILDER

A system for mass deploying and updating Flashrd-based OpenBSD systems.


BACKGROUND

Much of my experience is in working with mass deployment of systems, so I tend
to kick around these sorts of things even for a few hosts. In my case, I have
three OpenBSD routers that I maintain using flashrd and nsh. While I could
easily handle that number manually, I tend to think of how to automate the
process quite naturally. Part of it is due to that fact that OpenBSD is so
reliable that I rarely need to touch it. As a result, a lot of procedures stale
out from my memory in the six months between releases. It's a lot easier if I
automate the deployment process and don't have to remember quite so much. I'm
also influenced by having used Sonicwall's GMS, which allows an admin to mass
configure and administer hundreds of firewalls on a rule-driven basis. While I
don't think I need to go that far, deploying and updating a couple of dozen
OpenBSD-based routers is not uncommon, and doing that many one by one is a real
PITA.


GOALS

1) A single build should be produced for all systems involved. 
2) Setting the hostname should be the only customization at deployment time. 
3) There should be provisions for config settings that are common across all
systems and for config settings that are specific to each individual system. 
4) Some config files will require that additional lines be appended to an
existing config file. The most common case is /etc/master.passwd, to
pre-configure users on the system. 
5) Cryptographic keys (such as ssh host keys and ssl keys and certificates)
should be preserved. 
6) The mechanism should take advantage of the existing onetime mechanism. 
7) There should be a script that can be run on an existing system that grabs all
of the config pieces for a system and bundles them up.


HOW IT WORKS

On your development system, create a file tree that looks like the following:

oneTimeBase/
	CommonFiles/ -- For all systems 
		etc/
		flash/
			PACKAGES/
		tmp/
			APPEND/ -- files under here will be appended to existing files
				etc/
		usr/
			local
				bin/
	HostSpecificFiles/
		host1.example.com/
			etc/
				ssh/
				ssl/
				isakmpd/
			flash/
				PACKAGES
			tmp/
				host1.example.com/
					APPEND/
						etc/
			usr/
		host2.example.com/
			etc/
				ssh/
				ssl/
				isakmpd/
			flash/
				PACKAGES
			tmp/
				host2.example.com/
					APPEND/
						etc/
			usr/
		...

Guard this file tree very carefully, as it will contain cryptographic keys and
password hashes for *all* of your flashrd systems. Keeping it on an encrypted
file system would not be a bad ideas. For your convenience, an empty file tree
with the necessary directories is included in the flashrd builder directory as 
onetimeBase.tgz.


CAPTURING EXISTING HOST CONFIGURATIONS

To generate the file tree, run the script save_info on each of the individual
systems that you are going to pull into the mass deployment system.

The saved files will be placed into a file structure that is compatible with the
development system file tree, then tar'ed and gzipped. The entire process will
be done under the /flash directory by default. This should be safe, since on an
existing flashrd system that will put the saved files directly on the flash
media, and on a non-flashrd system the /flash directory almost certainly does
not exist. If you need to save the files somewhere else, change the SAVEDIR
variable in the save_info script so that it points to your desired save
location.

The files/directories that are captured by the script are:

	/etc/isakmpd
	/etc/iked
	/etc/ssh
	/etc/ssl
	/etc/sudoers
	/etc/adduser.conf
	/etc/adduser.message
	/etc/hostname.* 
	/etc/mygate
	/etc/pf.conf
	/etc/sysctl.conf
	
In addition, the last lines of the following files are captured by the script:

	/etc/master.passwd (all lines below the nobody user)
	/etc/group (all lines below the nobody group)
	/etc/rc.local (entire file)
	/etc/rc.conf.local (entire file)

These four files will be placed under the /tmp/hostname.example.com/APPEND
subdirectory for that host. 

There are many more config files and directories in /etc and possibly other
parts of the file system that may have been modified. The ones in the save_info
script are just the ones that are most commonly modified or contain unique
system private keys. If you have additional files that you need to capture from
multiple systems you can edit the script to capture them. 

One technique you can use to locate potential targets is to use /usr/bin/find to
locate changed files. 

	sudo find /etc -newer /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key -ls

This will list all files that have been modified since the
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key host key file was generated. Since this file is
automatically generated the first time a system is booted up (unless you saved
the ssh host key files from a previous incarnation of the host), it serves as a
pretty good marker to locate config files that may have been modified since the
system was first booted up. Some of the files may not be significant; for
instance, some of the /etc/firmware files may have been updated if you have
update the system since the initial installation. 

rc.local and rc.conf.local are treated as append files because flashrd has
commands in them that perform essential tasks such as expanding tardirs. If the
scripts were simply replaced, then there would be multiple failures at boot.

Copy each of the resulting .tgz files from the existing hosts to your
development system and un-tar them into the HostSpecificFiles directory, filling
in the file tree.

sudo tar zxpf hostname.example.com -C /path/to/oneTimeBase/HostSpecificFiles

Now comes the manual part of the process. You need to separate out the files
that are common across the whole set of mass-deployed machines, and move them
into the CommonFiles subtree. This isn't strictly necessary, but in the long run
it will help with maintainability. Some files are almost certainly
host-specific, e.g., the isakmpd, iked, and ssh directories. Others are more
likely to be general. Some may have elements of both. For instance, there may be
a set of users that is common to all machines (and thus will be appended to
passwd and master.passwd from the CommonFiles), but there may also be users that
are host-specific. As long as there are no username/uid conflicts, everything
should be OK. For instance, in my configuration I have both common and
host-specific appends to rc.conf.local and rc.local.

Once you have created the file tree on your development system, you don't need
to run save_info again. You only need to update the information in the file tree
with any changes. If you are using nsh to manage the system, you probably won't
need to make any changes if you preserve nshrc in /flash.

PACKAGES

Any packages found in /flash/PACKAGES will be installed as part of the onetime
setup. Just put the package into the directory in the file tree and it will be
installed. Packages  will be installed in alphabetical order, so you may want to
re-name packages so that packages that depend on other packages are installed
later in the process. You can include packages in the onetime.tgz file or you 
can place them on the flash media separately. 

PREPARING THE FLASHRD CONFIGURATION

Make sure that all of the files are in the file tree and have the correct
ownership and permissions. Be sure that append files are in the correct location
under the tmp/APPEND subdirectory, and packages are the correct version and
alphabetical order in the tmp/PACKAGES subdirectory.

1. Run the script build_onetime, giving the path to the oneTimeBase directory as
the argument. 
2. Run flashrd to create a flashimg-XXX file. 
3. Run cfgflashrd against the image file, using a generic hostname rather than a
hostname for a specific host, and using onetime.tgz file that was generated by 
the build_onetime command as the argument for the -o option.

INSTALLING TO A NEW DISK

This is for a brand new disk that will be swapped into an existing host.

4. Run growimg to copy the flashimg-XXX file to the new disk. 
5. Create a text file /etc/myname on the flash drive that contains the fully 
qualified hostname for that system, to match the directory name in the tree above. 
6. Copy any desired packages into the /PACKAGES directory on the flash drive, 
renaming them as desired to ensure that they install in the correct order. 
7. Swap out the disks, powerup, and in a few minutes you're ready to go. 

UPGRADING IN PLACE

This is to upgrade a host in place.

4. Extract and copy the bsd, openbsd.vnd, and var.tar files from the
flashimg-XXX file by following the instructions in the FAQ. 
5. Copy the three files over to the flashrd system and move them into place, 
following the instructions for upgrading an existing system given in the FAQ. 
6. Copy the onetime.tgz file to /flash on the current system. 
7. Make sure that there is a text file called /flash/etc/myname that contains the 
fully qualified hostname for that system, to match the directory name in the tree 
above. 
8. Copy any desired NEW packages into the /flash/PACKAGES directory. Since this 
should happen only once, and only to an absolutely brand new system, there is no
attempt made to upgrade existing packages. 
9. Reboot the system, and in a few minutes you're ready to go.

HOW IT WORKS

The build_onetime script sets up the files from the file tree so that it is easy
to expand targets into place. The script first goes through and creates
host-specific .tar.gz files from the subdirectories within the HostSpecificFiles
directory. The host-specific .tar.gz files are placed into the /flash
subdirectory under the CommonFiles directory. Then the entire contents of
CommonFiles is .tar.gz'd up to form the onetime.tgz file. Lastly, the
host-specific .tgz files are clean up out of the /flash subdirectory. 

On first boot, the work is done by the rc.flashrd.onetime script. The
onetime.tgz file is expanded into place at the root of the file system, neatly
dropping into place all of the files common to all hosts. The tar'd and gzipped
host-specific files are dropped into the /flash subdirectory. Then any
host-specific files are expanded into place from the correct .tgz file.

Any files in the /tmp/APPEND directory will be appended to the corresponding
files in the various subdirectories. After that, any files in the
/tmp/hostname.example.com/APPEND directory will be similarly appended to the
corresponding files.

Once that is all done, the onetime.tgz and host-specific .tar.gz files are
deleted, since they contain the private keys for *all* of the hosts.

FLASHRD BOOT PROCESS

Just as a reference.

1. RAMdisk/kernel/crunchgen-based root boots 
2. /etc/rc from kernel RAMdisk runs, calls /stand/rc 
3. /stand/rc runs, mounts vnd disks, /flash media 
4. System default /etc/rc runs from vnd disks, executes (in following order)
	rc.conf
		rc.conf.local
			rc.flashrd.conf (skips because mounts are not ready)
			rc.flashrd.sub (skips because mounts are not ready)
			rc.flashrd.onetime (skips because mounts are not ready)
	wsconsctl.conf
	sysctl.conf
	netstart
		rc.conf
			rc.conf.local
				rc.flashrd.conf
				rc.flashrd.sub
				rc.flashrd.onetime
	rc.firstime
	rc.d/
	rc.local
		rc.flashrd.local
