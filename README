NSH is a CLI intended for OpenBSD-based routers running little except for
sshd, targeted towards flash-based systems.  It is freely licensed, in the BSD
style.

The idea is to allow simple, quick management of a router *without*
requiring the user to be familiar with ifconfig, route, netstat, pfctl,
and the various configuration files in /etc which are otherwise required to
manage this type of router (In fact, we eliminate the use of those
commands and /etc configuration files entirely!).

In conjunction with the OpenBSD kernel, sshd, (and perhaps one or more of
dhcpd, isakmpd, bgpd, ripd, ospfd, relayd and snmpd) you have a fully
functioning system.

>> Command line interface functions
 * Add/delete/show/flush/monitor IP routes
 * Manage and view BGP, OSPF, RIP, IPSEC, DHCP, DVMRP, SNMP, NTP configuration
 * Display detailed information regarding an interface
 * Configure interfaces for IP, MTU, VLAN, media, and other properties
 * Show host (TCP, UDP) and router (IP, MBUF) statistics
 * Configure Packet Filter, NAT, and ALTQ system-wide
 * Configure bridges for members, rules
 * Save all current network configuration to a single, easy to read text file

>> Features
 * Comes with a manual
 * This shell replaces most of /etc/rc, /etc/netstart on an embedded system.
   Simply started as nsh -i, it will read the previously saved configuration
   and execute it on the system.
 * Via nwrapper, nsh can optionally start as a user's login shell from ssh,
   or console.
 * Via save-ro.sh, writes permanent config to read-only flash space
 * Nsh allows privileged users to escape to bourne shell for functions not
   built in to nsh itself.

>> Contributors
 * Jose Nazario <jose@monkey.org> contributed command functions from the
   OpenSoekris project for reboot, shutdown, writing the config out, 
   and some fixes to the config generator. 
 * Christian Gut contributed password save functions.
 * Mats Mellstrand <mats@exmandato.se> contributed dhclient functionality
 * Manuel Pata <pata@alface.de> contributed various bits of cleanup,
   and new commands for lladdr, carp, trunk and txpower

>> Why a Cisco-like interface? Why bother to use OpenBSD for routers?
It's easier to manage (one config for all features) and easier to train Cisco-
centric and Juniper-centric users on.

>> On Features
At the edge, it's obvious that people find OpenBSD to be very useful for a wide
variety of network management and operation tasks.  OpenBSD is an excellent
low-cost, high-quality alternative to closed, proprietary, expensive firewalls
from various vendors.  OpenBSD's features such as IPsec-encapsulated ethernet
bridging, IPsec itself, IPComp, highly extensible PF (integrating packet
filter, queueing, and network address translation,) layer 3-7 application 
redundancy and load-balancing with pf and relayd, 802.11 access point
mode with with novel security options (such as authpf), and complete firewall
(hot failover with CARP and PF state synchronization) all make OpenBSD a highly
secure and attractive edge solution.

At the core, enterprise level BGP, OSPF, RIP, DVMRP, SNMP, IPv6, tunneling,
route labeling, 802.1Q vlan interfaces, and tight integration between these
features and the packet filter make OpenBSD a natural choice.

>> On Appliances
You can create a wide range of appliances with these tools.

Modern embedded micro-PC systems like Soekris, and PC Engines present
a quick and easy base for low end, lower packet-per-second edge jobs.
They take compact flash, they use very little power, generate very little
heat, and with no fans or other motors, have very long lives.

Modern AMD64 class systems (Athlon 64, Pentium 4, Core 2) with OpenBSD
easily rival Cisco 7200 series or Juniper J series in both areas of speed
and functionality.  When combined with a flash based storage and high grade
components, the reliability rivals them as well.

>> On Extensibility
OpenBSD is fully programmable.  It offers a pcap userspace interface,
and full kernel source code ready for your own modification.  OpenBSD
is infinitely more extensible than a closed, commercial firewall or routing
product.  There is also a vast library of third party software, much
available right from the OpenBSD ports tree.  With it you may integrate
applications providing intrusion detection, spam filtering, web filtering,
instant message recording, email recording, and netflow data generation,
just to name a few.

>> On Cryptography
OpenBSD has long been the de-facto standard for tight operating system and
network system integration with cryptographic security measures.  It is one
of two reference standard IPsec implementations used by a consortium
comprised of all the major router vendors (vpnc.org). New IPsec products
from Cisco, Nortel, Juniper, Microsoft, Wind River, PGP, SSH Communications,
F-Secure, and many others are tested against OpenBSD IPsec and KAME IPsec,
(the consortium's reference standards.)

Likewise, OpenBSD's OpenSSH comes on Cisco routers, HP switches, MacOS X,
IBM's AIX, and Sun Solaris, not to mention just about every free OS out there!
OpenBSD was the first free OS to include full source code for a cryptographic
hardware accelerator driver and the first to fully implement it with IPsec.
