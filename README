nsh//network config shell//Chris Cappuccio <chris@nmedia.net> version 1.0

NSH is a CLI intended for OpenBSD-based routers running little except for
sshd, targeted towards flash-based systems.  It is freely licensed, in the BSD
style.

The idea is to allow simple, quick management of a router *without*
requiring the user to be familiar with ifconfig, route, netstat, pfctl,
and the various configuration files in /etc which are otherwise required to
manage this type of router.

In conjunction with the OpenBSD kernel, sshd, (and perhaps one or more of
dhcpd, isakmpd, bgpd, ripd, ospfd, relayd, snmpd and other supported tools)
you have a fully functioning system.

>> Command line interface functions
 * Add/delete/show/flush/monitor IPv4, IPv6 routes
 * Manage and view BGP, OSPF, RIP, IPSEC, DHCP, DVMRP, SNMP, NTP and many others
   configuration
 * Display detailed information regarding an interface
 * Configure interfaces for IPv4, IPv6, MTU, VLAN, media, and other properties
 * Show host (TCP, UDP) and router (IP, MBUF, IFQ drops) statistics
 * Configure Packet Filter, NAT, and ALTQ system-wide
 * Configure bridges for members, rules
 * Save all current network configuration to a single, easy to read text file

>> Features
 * Comes with a manual
 * This shell replaces most of /etc/rc, /etc/netstart on an embedded system.
   Simply started as nsh -i, it will read the previously saved configuration
   and execute it on the system.
 * Via nwrapper, nsh can optionally start as a user's login shell from ssh,
   or console.
 * Via save-ro.sh, writes permanent config to read-only flash space
 * Nsh allows privileged users to escape to bourne shell for functions not
   built in to nsh itself.

>> See TODO for details on implementation status and future ideas.

>> Why a Cisco-like interface?
It's easier to manage (one config for all features) and easier to train Cisco-
centric users on.
