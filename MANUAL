Section 1 > Overview
--------------------

Network Shell is a command line interface designed to facilitate network
configuration on the OpenBSD operating system.  The command line notation
is simple and terse.  This manual explains NSH's functions to you.

NSH is a shell to the OpenBSD kernel's networking functions.  The kernel
handles routing of packets, firewalling, network address translation,
rate limiting, bandwidth queueing, LAN bridging, IP tunneling, and
encryption (IP security).  NSH provides simple wrappers around these
functions to aid you in setting up a network.  The goal of this software
is to make the command syntax uniform, and bring all configuration together
with a single configuration file.  The command line interface is loosely
modeled around the concepts used in Cisco's popular interface.  


Section 2 > Installation
------------------------

NSH replaces /etc/netstart on a standard OpenBSD system.  To implement NSH on
such a system, you first need to convert your standard configuration into one
which is compatible with NSH's syntax.  You need to compile NSH in order
to use it.  NSH currently requires OpenBSD 3.3 or a later version.  To compile
NSH:

$ tar xvf nsh.tar
...
$ cd nsh
$ make
...

When this is done, you will have a binary in the nsh directory named 'nsh'.
Copy this to /bin/nsh or /usr/local/bin/nsh.  

# cp nsh /bin/nsh

The next step is to copy over the appropriate script which will save the
permanent configuration. 

If /etc is read-only and /var/run is read-write, you need to use the
save-ro.sh script:

# cp save-ro.sh /usr/local/bin/save.sh

Make sure that save-ro.sh actually takes the appropriate actions to make
/etc a read-write partition.  (Or, modify it to move nshrc to a different
location that can be written to.  Of course, the nsh startup command must
reflect this location as well.)

If /etc and /var/run are read-write, you need to use the save-rw.sh script:

# cp save-rw.sh /usr/local/bin/save.sh

To create nsh's initial configuration, run nsh on your router/firewall
which is already configured, and save the running configuration to disk,
as detailed below.  Nsh will merge your PF/NAT/ALTQ rules into /etc/nshrc.
When you use the 'write-config' command, NSH will learn your configurations
from the running kernel.  It will enter everything that is currently configured
into the nsh startup file.

# mv /etc/pf.conf /var/run/pf.conf
# nsh
% NSH v20030208
machine/enable
Password:
machine(priv)/write-config
% Configuration saved
machine(priv)/ 

At this point, you should inspect and edit /etc/nshrc by hand to ensure that
it does exactly what you want.  Since it reads the entire configuration out of
the kernel, you may find things that you did not intend to save permanently.

There is a small section in the /etc/rc startup script which reads:

# set hostname, turn on network
echo 'starting network'
. /etc/netstart

if [ "X${pf}" != X"NO" ]; then
        if [ -f ${pf_rules} ]; then
                pfctl -f ${pf_rules}
        fi
fi

Go ahead and remove (or just comment out) these lines from the startup script.
None of the netstart or pfctl section from /etc/rc are used when nsh is 
installed!

Move the cursor so it is positioned just after the "clean up left-over files"
section or about 28 lines past the former network startup section.   Position
the cursor after the following lines in the startup script:

(cd /var/run && { test -r dhclient.pid && dhclient_pid=`cat dhclient.pid`; rm -r
f -- *; install -c -m 664 -g utmp /dev/null utmp; test -n "$dhclient_pid" && ech
o "$dhclient_pid" > dhclient.pid; })
(cd /var/authpf && rm -rf -- *)

After these lines, add the following commands:

nsh -i /etc/nshrc | tee /var/run/nsh.out

You may even want verbose output to see how nsh parses its' rc file:

nsh -vi /etc/nshrc | tee /var/run/nsh.out

On a router created with flashdist, you can simply copy NSH into /bin/nsh
and save nshrc to /etc/nshrc.  The default startup script (/etc/rc) with
flashdist will automatically use NSH if it is present.  You may need to edit 
it to specify "nsh -i /etc/nshrc" instead of simply "nsh -i nshrc" which 
was the default with some versions of flashdist.

You are done.  When NSH starts from /etc/rc, it will automatically load up
the network configuration into the kernel.  At this point, you are free to
view and manipulate the configuration from nsh.


Section 3 > Main mode commands
------------------------------

All nsh modes give you basic command line editing features.  You can
use the up arrow on most keyboards to go through the last commands
you entered and repeate them.  Any command that takes action in the
system can be reversed by prefixing it with 'no '.

Any command can be abbreviated.  For example, 'show interface' can
be written as 'show int'.  A command like 'show i' is too much of an
abbreviation, since it matches 'show interface', 'show ipstats', 'show
icmpstats', and so on.  If you enter an ambiguous command, nsh will
tell you so.

nsh/show i
% Ambiguous argument i

help
----

When you enter NSH, you will see the prompt.  It starts with your
machine name and a forward slash.  For simplicity, our example machine
name here is 'nsh'.  At the prompt, you can enter commands detailed in this
document.  The first command is simply 'help' or '?', which brings up
the main menu of commands.

nsh/?
% Commands may be abbreviated.
% Commands are:

  show     Show system information
  enable   Enable privileged mode
  quit     Close current connection
  verbose  Set verbose diagnostics
  editing  Set command line editing
  ?        Print help information

enable
------

Many commands require privileged access to execute.  If you know the
correct password, you can obtain privileged access.  The menu of commands
increases when you enter privileged mode.

nsh/enable
Password:
nsh(priv)/?
% Commands may be abbreviated.
% Commands are:

  hostname      Set system hostname
  interface     Modify interface parameters
  bridge        Modify bridge parameters
  show          Show system information
  flush         Flush system tables
  disable       Disable privileged mode
  route         Add a host or network route
  pf            Packet filter rule handler
  quit          Close current connection
  reload        Reboot the system
  shutdown      Shut the system down
  write-config  Save the current configuration
  verbose       Set verbose diagnostics
  editing       Set command line editing
  !             Invoke a subshell
  ?             Print help information


To set the password you must be in privileged mode. Set it either with
"enable secret <yourpassword>" or 
"enable secret <cipher> <crypted password>".
NSH at the moment only supports blowfish as cipher.

Examples:

nsh(priv)/enable secret foo

or with an already crypted password:

nsh(priv)/enable secret blowfish $2a$06$eQYswZjAHop5UFC8yle85uEqi/MCBhnWBi8IRU60LmkVvgZmtBiOm

You can generate a blowfish-crypted password using encrypt -b6.

hostname <hostname>
-------------------

Set system hostname.  Requires privileged mode.

nsh(priv)/hostname firewall.xyz.com
firewall.xyz.com(priv)/

verbose
-------

Verbose mode causes many nsh commands to display extra information.  It is
very useful in diagnostic and troubleshooting sessions to enable this
mode.

nsh/verbose
% Diagnostic mode enabled

If you do not wish to have the extra information displayed, you may
disable verbose mode.

nsh/no verbose
% Diagnostic mode disabled

write-config
------------

This will save the running configuration to the permanent configuration
space.  Upon the next startup of the system, the saved configuration will
be used.

nsh(priv)/write-config
% Configuration saved
nsh(priv)/

halt
----

This will shut down the system.  Requires privileged access.

nsh(priv)/halt
% Shutdown initiated

reload
------

This will reboot the system.  Requires privileged access.

nsh(priv)/reload
% Reload initiated

show
----

The main diagnostic and informational command is 'show'.  

nsh/show ?
% Commands may be abbreviated.
% 'show' commands are:

  hostname        Router hostname
  interface       Interface config
  route           IP route table or route lookup
  ipstats         IP statistics
  ahstats         AH statistics
  espstats        ESP statistics
  tcpstats        TCP statistics
  udpstats        UDP statistics
  icmpstats       ICMP statistics
  igmpstats       IGMP statistics
  ipcompstats     IPCOMP statistics
  rtstats         Routing statistics
  mbufstats       Memory management statistics
  monitor         Monitor routing/arp table changes
  version         Software information
  running-config  Operating configuration
  startup-config  Startup configuration
  ?               Options

show hostname
-------------

This will display the system's currently assigned hostname.

nsh/show hostname
% nsh

show interface
--------------

This command displays essential information about a system's network interfaces
and network bridges.  Using 'show interface' by itself will show information
about all interfaces and bridges available on a system.  Using 
'show interface <ifname>' will show information about a specific interface.

nsh/show interface lo0
% lo0
  Interface is up, protocol is up
  Interface type Loopback
  Internet address is 127.0.0.1/8
  MTU 33224 bytes
  124 packets input, 22396 bytes, 0 errors, 0 drops
  124 packets output, 22396 bytes, 0 errors, 0 unsupported
  180 avg input size, 180 avg output size

"Interface is up" means that the interface is turned on in software. 
"Protocol is up" means that the interface is configured and ready to run.
The "Interface type" explains what the interface is used for on
the system.  Some interfaces are not intended to pass traffic for network
users, and instead handle internal functions on the system.  See
Appendix A for more information on common interface types.

"Internet address" shows the IP address configured for the interface,
if any.  MTU describes the Maximum Transmission Unit, the largest size of
a packet which the kernel will transmit on this interface.  

The statistics show the number of packets, bytes, errors, and dropped
packets in both incoming and outgoing directions.  The average input/output
sizes describes the median size of packets going in and out the interface.
Note that the total bytes in and/or out may not be accurate.  OpenBSD uses
an unsigned long type to hold the byte count.  When the byte count exceeds
the storage limit of an unsigned long (4,294,967,295 on a 32 bit architecture
or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 on a 64-bit architecture), the counter will
overflow, causing it to roll over to 0.  The average packet size will be
inaccurate when the total byte count rolls over, because the total number of
packets will reflect bytes that are no longer counted.

With verbose mode enabled, 'show interface' will display the raw kernel
flags for an interface.  See Appendix B for an explanation of these flags.

nsh/show int lo0
% lo0
  Interface is up, protocol is up
  Interface type Loopback
  Internet address is 127.0.0.1/8
  MTU 33224 bytes
  124 packets input, 22396 bytes, 0 errors, 0 drops
  124 packets output, 22396 bytes, 0 errors, 0 unsupported
  180 avg input size, 180 avg output size
  Flags:
    <UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST>

With a bridge, verbose mode will show spanning tree member states and
bridge members.

nsh/show int bridge0
% bridge0
  Bridge is up (last change 00:00:21), protocol is up
  Interface type Ethernet Bridge
  0 packets input, 0 bytes, 0 errors, 0 drops
  0 packets output, 0 bytes, 0 errors, 0 unsupported
  Flags:
    <UP,RUNNING>
  STP member state:
    sis0: listening

With an IEEE 802.11 wireless interface, verbose mode will show
the network ID, network key, and powersaving mode (if enabled).

nsh/show int wi0
% wi0
  BLah blah
  IEEE 802.11
    network id blah
    network key blah
    powersaving (111 ms)

With an interface that supports media commands, including Ethernet
and IEEE 802.11 wireless interfaces, verbose mode will show which
media types are available.

nsh/show int sis0
% sis0
...
  Supported media types:
    media none
    media 10baseT
    media 10baseT, mediaopt full-duplex
    media 100baseTX
    media 100baseTX, mediaopt full-duplex
    media autoselect

show route
----------

A dump of the routing table, including ARP entries.

nsh/show route
Flags: U - up, G - gateway, H - host, L - link layer, R - reject (unreachable),
       D - dynamic, S - static

The destination column is simply the destination network which the
route describes.  The gateway is the next hop for this route to pass through.
Gateways which are described as 'link#' are local area networks or members
of local area networks.

The flags are useful to determine if the kernel is using a particular
route or not.

U - up
  This route is active
G - gateway
  The destination of this route is behind a gateway (next hop).
H - host
  This route describes a host on the local network.
L - link layer
  The destination has been or needs to be discovered through a layer 2 protocol
R - reject
  This route is unreachable, and therefore marked unusable in the kernel
D - dynamic
  This is a dynamic route which has is managed through routing software on
  the local system (such as GateD or Zebra)
S - static
  This is a static route set by a user

show ipstats
------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to Internet Protocol usage
related to both local machine and its gateway functions.

show ahstats
------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to Authentication Header
(IPsec) usage related to both the local machine and its gateway functions.

show espstats
-------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to Encapsulated Security Payload
(IPsec) usage related to both the local machine and its gateway functions.

show tcpstats
-------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to Transmission Control Protocol
usage on the local machine.

show udpstats
-------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to User Datagram Protocol usage
on the local machine.

show icmpstats
--------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to Internet Control Message
Protocol usage on the local machine.

show igmpstats
--------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to Internet Group Message
Protocol usage on the local machine.

show ipcomptats
---------------

This displays a variety of statistics related to IP Compression Protocol
(IPComp) usage related to both the local machine and its gateway functions.

show rtstats
------------

This displays a variety of statistics kept in the kernel's routing engine.

show mbufstats
--------------

The kernel has a private pool of memory buffers called 'mbufs'.  This
displays a variety of statistics kept in the kernel's memory management

show monitor
------------

This causes the user to enter monitor mode for the routing socket.  The  
monitor displays raw descriptions of the data passing into the kernel's
routing socket and dumps of the kernel's routing messages to the machine.
Press enter or control-C to exit this mode.

show version
------------

This displays basic information about the host and about NSH, such as
the version of NSH installed, the system's  uptime and kernel version.  
It also shows both the kernel that NSH was compiled under, and the
current kernel that NSH is running under.  NSH should always be running
on a kernel that is of a similar version to the version of the kernel/header
files that NSH was compiled under.  This ensures that NSH will talk to
the kernel properly.

show running-config
-------------------

This shows the current running configuration on the system, including
interface and bridge configurations, routes, the system hostname, firewall
rules, and other information compiled by nsh.  See Appendix C for
example configuration files.

show startup-config
-------------------

This shows the startup configuration on the system, read from nshrc,
including interface and bridge configurations, routes, the system hostname,
firewall rules, and other information compiled by nsh.  See Appendix C for
example configuration files.

flush
-----

Flush will empty various system tables

flush routes
------------

This will empty the system routing table

flush arp
---------

This will empty the system arp cache and static arp table

flush bridge-dyn <bridge>
-------------------------

This will flush dynamically learned members from the named bridge

nsh/flush bridge-dyn bridge0

This would delete all dynamically learned members from bridge0.  Any
members set manually (static members) will not be removed.

flush bridge-all <bridge>
-------------------------

This will flush dynamically and statically learned members from the named bridge

nsh/flush bridge-all bridge0

flush bridge-rule <bridge> <interface>
--------------------------------------

This will flush all rules on the named bridge for a specifc interface.

nsh/flush bridge-all bridge0 sis0

flush history
-------------

This will clear the command history

disable
-------

Leave privileged mode, use this if you want to stay logged in but to not
trust your terminal area

route <destination>[/<bitmaskORnetmask>] <gateway>
--------------------------------------------------

You can add static routes with this command.  It takes CIDR netmasks
(number of bits) or classic IP netmasks to describe routes.  This 
command only runs in privileged mode.

nsh(priv)/route 192.168.0.0/16 1.2.3.4

is equivalent to:

nsh(priv)/route 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 1.2.3.4

This command takes the 'no ' prefix to remove a route.  The gateway
is not necessary when using the 'no route' notation.

nsh(priv)/no route 192.168.0.0/16

If you do not specify a mask, it will assume you are routing a host
address

nsh(priv)/route 10.6.6.4 1.2.3.4

quit
----

Leave NSH

verbose
-------

Set verbose mode on.  (It defaults to off)

This command takes the 'no ' prefix to turn off verbose mode.

editing
-------

Set command line editing on.  (If defaults to on)

This command takes the 'no ' prefix to turn off editing mode.

!
-

Invoke a shell command (requires privileged mode.)

Your system may have this feature disabled to enhance security.

nsh(priv)/!ls
helloworld.c
nsh(priv)/!
$ 

ip
--

Enable, allow, or set system parameters or features (requires privileged mode.)

All commands in this category allow the 'no' modifier to disable the option.

  ?                   Options

[no] interface <ifname>
-----------------------

nsh(priv)/interface vlan0

If vlan0 does not exist, this will create the interface.  If it was possible
to create the interface, or if the named interface already exists, you
will noe be in the interface command mode, documented below in Section 4.

nsh(priv)/no interface vlan0

Alternately, if vlan0 does exist, you can remove the interface with
the 'no interface' syntax.  This only works for interface types which
support creation and removal.

[no] ip forwarding
------------------

nsh(priv)/ip forwarding

Enable IP packet forwarding.  This must be set in order to use routing,
NAT, IPsec or packet filter features.

[no] ip ipip
------------

nsh(priv)/ip ipip

Allow IP-in-IP encapsulation.  

[no] ip gre
-----------

nsh(priv)/ip gre

Allow Generic Route Encapsulation.  Must be used to enable gre interfaces.

[no] ip wccp
------------

nsh(priv)/ip wccp

Allow GRE-based Web Cache Control Protocol packets to manage caching device.
Must be used to enable WCCP on gre interfaces.

[no] ip mobileip
----------------

nsh(priv)/ip mobileip

Allow GRE-based MobileIP encapsulation.  Must be used to enable MobileIP
operation on gre interfaces.

[no] ip etherip
---------------

nsh(priv)/ip etherip

Allow Ether-IP encapsulation

[no] ip ipcomp
--------------

nsh(priv)/ip ipcomp

Allow IPComp compression to be used.

[no] ip esp
-----------

nsh(priv)/ip esp

Allow IPsec Encapsulated Security Payload to be used.  Note this is a system
default.

[no] ip ah
----------

nsh(priv)/ip ah

Allow IPsec Authentication Header to be used. Note this is a sysdem default.

[no] ip sourceroute
-------------------

nsh(priv)/ip sourceroute

Process loose or strict source routing options on IP packet headers.  Do
not enable this option on systems connected to the public internet.

[no] ip encdebug
----------------

nsh(priv)/ip encdebug

Print debugging messages for the if_enc interface to the kernel output.  
Requires a kernel compiled with option ENCDEBUG.

[no] ip maxqueue <argument>
---------------------------

nsh(priv)/ip maxqueue 1000

Maximum number of queued packets before they are dropped.  Increasing
this option does not necessarily help with system performance.

[no] ip send-redirects
----------------------

nsh(priv)/ip send-redirects

Controls whether or not the system sends ICMP redirects to local hosts.  This
option is enabled by default.

When there is a direct path on the local network from one host to another, but
one of those hosts chooses to talk through the router instead, it will
send an ICMP redirect to the originating host.  This redirect tells the host
the direct path on the network to send further packets.

[no] ip default-ttl <ttl>
-------------------------

nsh(priv)/ip default-ttl 128

Sets the default ttl used on IP packets originating from this system.  

The TTL, or time-to-live, is decremented by one each time the packet passes
through another router on the internet.  The default TTL that the system
uses is 64, therefore it allows for the packet to pass through up to 64
routers (also called hops) before reaching its destination.  The main purpose
of the TTL is to avoid routing loops in the network.

Set routing metric for the interface.  Using 'no metric' will set the
interface metric to the default value of zero.

nsh(interface-fxp0)/metric 2

[no] link <0|1|2>
-----------------

Set any of the link flags on the interface.  Using 'no link XYZ' will remove
the specified link flags.  Using 'no link' will remove all link flags from
the interface.

nsh(interface-gre0)/no link 0

Each different interface type uses link flags for different purposes.  See
Appendix E for a detailed explanation of how to use link flags.

[no] arp
--------

Turn on or off the Address Resolution Protocol.  The default is on.

nsh(interface-fxp0)/arp
nsh(interface-fxp0)/no arp

[no] nwid <id>
--------------

Set the network ID for an 802.11 capable interface.  Using 'no nwid'
will set it to the default value of a blank network ID.

[no] nwkey <key>
----------------

Set the WEP network key for an 802.11 capable interface.  Using 'no nwkey'
will turn off WEP.

[no] powersave [time]
-------------------

Set the 802.11 powersaving mode to X ms of time.  Using 'no powersave'
will set it to the default time.

[no] media <type> [instance]
----------------------------

Set the media type to X.  You can see the available media types on
an interface by setting verbose mode and looking at the interface.

You can set or remove media options with this command.

nsh(interface-fxp0)/mediaopt full-duplex
nsh(interface-fxp0)/no mediaopt full-duplex

[no] tunnel <src ip> <dest ip>
------------------------------

You can set or remove tunnel assignments with this command.  Note that
tunnel assignments are only valid on gif and gre interfaces at this time.
See Appendix E for more details.

nsh(interface-gre0)/tunnel 12.3.3.3 12.6.6.6

[no] vlan <tag> <parent interface>
----------------------------------

You can set or remove vlan assignments with this command.  Note that vlan
assignments are only valid on the vlan inteface.  See Appendix E for more
details.

nsh(interface-vlan0)/vlan 4 fxp3

This would set vlan0 to use vlan ID 4 on parent (trunk) interface fxp3.

The parent interface must be a real, physical interface on the system.

[no] debug
----------

Set the driver-dependant debugging flag for an interface.  Useful for
troubleshooting.

nsh(interface-xyz)/debug

[no] shutdown
-------------

Shut down or turn up an interface.

Using this command to shutdown and then turn up an interface will reset it.

nsh(interface-de0)/shutdown
nsh(interface-de0)/no shutdown

?
-

This will display the command menu.

Section 5 > Bridge mode commands
--------------------------------

Section 6 > PF mode commands
----------------------------

Section 7 > Adding system users to nsh
--------------------------------------

OpenBSD has facilities for a user to be able to login directly to nsh without
having access to a typical bourne or C shell.

1a. Configure the user so they can run /bin/nsh from sudo.  You must
do this in /etc/sudoers, like this:

nshuser		ALL=NOPASSWD:/bin/nsh

(replace 'nshuser' with the actual user name)

1b. Another way to configure sudoers is to allow all users that are members
of a certain group to run NSH through sudo, like this:

%nshgroup	ALL=NOPASSWD:/bin/nsh

(replace 'nshgroup' with the actual group name)

2. Compile nwrapper (in the nsh distribution):

cc -o nwrapper nwrapper.c

3. Move nwrapper to a permanent location:

mv nwrapper /bin/nwrapper

4. Change the user's shell to nwrapper:

usermod -s /bin/nwrapper nshuser

(replace 'nshuser' with the actual user name)

Do NOT add nwrapper (or nsh) to /etc/shells.  They should not be entered
here.


Appendix A > Common interface types
-----------------------------------

Packet Filter Logging: This interface is used to pass traffic logged by
the firewall to software which can record it.  These interface names
start with 'pflog'.

IPsec Loopback: This interface is used internally in the system to
pass decapsulated IPsec traffic.  All traffic from this interface has
already been authenticated and unencrypted from the IPsec subsystem.  This
is useful when writing firewall rules.  These interface names start with
'enc'.

Generic Tunnel: This interface is used to configure a network tunnel to
another host or router.  It follows the RFC1933 tunneling standard.  These
interface names start with 'gif'.

Ethernet Bridge: This interface is used to configure layer 2 bridging
between physical and virtual network ports on a system.  These interface
names start with 'bridge'.

Ethernet: This is a physical Ethernet interface, running at 10, 100, or
1000 megabits per second.  These interface names are based on the name
of the driver, and vary with different Ethernet chip types.

IEEE 802.1Q Virtual: This is a virtual Ethernet, Token Ring, or FDDI
interface.  It uses the IEEE 802.1Q protocol to segment real Ethernet
interfaces into multiple layer 2 networks.  These interface names start
with 'vlan'.

Virtual: This is a virtual interface of any type.  Often several different
interfaces will all use this type.  Several versions of OpenBSD use this
type to denote virtual IEEE 802.1Q interfaces, described above.

PPP: This interface implements the Point to Point Protocol (PPP).  PPP,
described in RFC 1661, creates a network over serial communication lines.
It is used over modem connections, direct serial links, leased lines, and
over virtual IP based connections such as in SSH sessions.  These interface
names start with 'ppp' when referring to a version which supports
serial and modem connections.  Other interface types may also implement the
Point to Point Protocol.

IEEE 802.11 Wireless: This interface implements the IEEE 802.11 wireless
LAN protocol.  Many implementations of this network have little or no
security unless used with proper encryption such as IPsec.  These interface
names are based on the name of the driver, and vary with different 
wireless chip types.


Appendix B > Interface flags
----------------------------

UP
  Interface is up
BROADCAST
  Broadcast address valid
DEBUG
  Turn on debugging (only some network drivers use this)
LOOPBACK
  Interface is a loopback network (internal to the machine) 
POINTOPOINT
  Interface is point-to-point link
NOARP
  Address Resolution Protocol is disabled on this interface
PROMISC
  Interface is in promiscuous mode, it will cause the system's software to
  receive all packets visible to the network card, even if they are not
  destined for this host
ALLMULTI
  This causes the interface to receive all multicast traffic, even for
  multicast networks that it was not signed up for
OACTIVE
  Transmission in progress
  An interface that displays this flag continuously may be stuck.  You
  may be able to reset an interface that is in this state by using and then
  reversing the 'shutdown' command from the interface menu.  For example,

nsh/interface fxp0
nsh(interface-fxp0)/shutdown
nsh(interface-fxp0)/no shutdown

SIMPLEX
  Can't hear own transmissions
LINK0
  This flag has different meanings with different interface types
LINK1
  This flag has different meanings with different interface types
LINK2
  This flag has different meanings with different interface types
MULTICAST
  This interface supports multicast


Appendix C > Configuration examples
-----------------------------------

Appendix D > ALTQ notes
-----------------------

Appendix E > Interface-specific notes
-------------------------------------

There are several special interfaces.  

gre
---
The gre interface allows for tunnel construction using the Cisco GRE or
Mobile-IP (RFC 2004) encapsulation protocols.  You can use the tunnel 
command under interface mode to create a tunnel.

nsh(interface-gre0)/tunnel 1.2.3.4 5.5.5.5

Two link flags exist for gre.  Link flag 0, set by default, enables GRE mode.
The lack of link flag 0 enables MobileIP mode.  

nsh(interface-gre0)/no link 0

lo
--
lo is the loopback interface.  It is used for traffic that does not
leave the system/router.  

Setting the link 1 flag will cause a loopback interface to answer for
all addresses identified as being in the super-net which is specified
in the address and netmask.  

To make the router answer for 208.44.76.0 through 208.44.76.7, you would
do this:

nsh(interface-lo1)/ip 208.44.76.0/29
nsh(interface-lo1)/link 1

enc (IPsec Loopback)
---
enc (specifically, enc0) is the encapsulating interface.  It is a software
loopback mechanism used to control non-encapsulated IPsec traffic using the
pf firewall ruleset.  It allows an administrator to see outgoing packets
before they have been processed by IPsec, or incoming packets after they
have been processed.

All traffic out of enc0 is already decrypted and authenticated via IPsec.
Thus, it is helpful when writing firewall rulesets.

ppp (Point to Point Protocol)
---

The serial line Point-to-Point protocol uses this interface.

sl (Serial Line Interface Protocol)
--

The Serial Line Internet Protocol uses this interface.

tun (Tunnel Interface)
---

This is another software loopback mechanism.  It allows user processes
to create their own virtual network interfaces.  It is used by the 
PPPoE implementation.

gif
---

This interface is used for RFC 1933 IPv[46] to IPv[46] tunnels.

nsh(interface-gif0)/tunnel 1.2.3.4 5.5.5.5

pflog
-----

Packets logged from the packet filter are visible on this interface

vlan
----

This interface type allows virtual LANs to be setup over an Ethernet
port using the 802.1Q protocol.  For instance, if you wanted to setup
a virtual interface with the 192.168.44.1 IP address, with 802.1Q trunking
on the fxp3 physical interface, and a vlan ID of 4, you would do this:

nsh(interface-vlan0)/vlan 4 fxp3
nsh(interface-vlan0)/ip 192.168.44.1/24
