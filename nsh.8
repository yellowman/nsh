.Sh NAME
.Nm nsh
.Nd network configuration shell
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nsh
.Op Fl ev
.Op Fl i Ar rcfile
.Op Fl c Ar config-script-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command interpreter intended for both interactive and shell script use.
.Nm
is an alternative to:
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr route 8 ,
and encapsulates configuration for other daemons into one place.
.Nm
provides an alternative to:
.Xr netstart 8
and parts of
.Xr rc 8 .
.Nm
has its own command language similar to the configuration language used by
many network appliance vendors.
.Pp
.Nm
encapsulates the many available networking services and daemons that are
included in
.Ox
base, see the
.Sx SEE ALSO
section for a complete list.
.Pp
.Nm
is a shell to configure
.Ox
kernel's networking functions such as routing
of packets, firewalling, network address translation, rate limiting,
bandwidth queueing, LAN bridging, IP tunnelling, and encryption.
.Nm
provides simple wrappers around these functions to aid setting up a network.
The goals of this software are:
.Bl -dash
.It
Make the command syntax uniform
.It
Bring all configuration together in a single configuration file
.It
Provide a wrapper for any
.Ox
ctl utility such as
.Xr ospfctl 8 ,
.Xr ipsecctl 8 ,
and
.Xr bgpctl 8 .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
encapsulates those configuration files, so that their native configuration
files are encapsulated within the
.Nm
configuration framework.
.Nm
does not in any way obfuscate the configuration syntax that is utilised or
provided by these ctl.c based programs.
.Nm
allows the administrator to view and edit all configuration in one place.
.Ss COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
When
.Nm
is run without arguments it loads an interactive shell.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Produce verbose output
.It Fl c Ar config-script-file
Execute the command(s) in the
.Ar config-script-file .
This is typically used to implement scripted changes to configuration.
.It Fl i Ar rcfile
Load the initial system configuration from the command(s) in the
.Ar rcfile .
This is typically used to clear the configuration and load a full
.Nm
configuration script from rcfile .
.It Fl e
Start
.Nm
in a privileged mode session.
This option is not intended to be used directly.
It is used internally by
.Nm
while restarting itself with root privileges when a non-root user runs the
.Cm enable
command.
.El
.Ss INTERACTIVE FEATURES
When run without any command line arguments,
.Nm
presents an interactive shell to the user.
If
.Nm
is run as root user then
.Nm
shall start as a privileged full functionality shell.
If
.Nm
is run as a non-root user then
.Nm
shall start as an unprivileged and limited functionality shell.
Privileged
.Nm
shell functionality can be enabled using the
.Cm enable
command.
.Pp
All
.Nm
interactive command line modes allow basic command line editing features from
.Xr editline 7
library.
The command history of the current session is available through the up / down
arrow keys.
.Pp
It is possible to repeat the commands from the command history.
.Pp
Any command can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is not ambiguous.
E.g. 'show running-config' can be abbreviated to 'sho run'.
.Pp
If the user enters a command that is ambiguous
.Nm
warns the user with 'Ambiguous argument' message,
E.g. ambiguous command entry.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nsh/show i
% Ambiguous argument i
.Ed
.Ss Command line completion
.Nm
has double <Tab> command line completion for user convenience if the command
is not ambiguous double <Tab> completes the command.
.Pp
E.g show all available valid commands  with double tab key sequence <tab><tab>
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nsh(config-p)/
!		disable		halt		ldap		ospf		relay		smtp		verbose
?		do		help		ldp		ospf6		resolv		snmp		who

ddb		ftp-proxy	ip6		nppp		rad		setenv		traceroute6
dhcp		group		ipsec		ntp		reboot		show		unsetenv
nsh(config-p)/
.Ed
If what is typed is ambiguous double tab presents the administrator
with the available command line options that match what has been typed thus
far.
.Pp
E.g. command line completion display for all commands begining with i
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nsh(config-p)/i
ifstate         inet            ip              ipsec
ike             interface       ip6
.Ed
.Ss Command History
Use the up arrow on most keyboards to review the previous commands entered in
the current session.
The command being currently viewed can be repeated by hitting enter.
.Ss Reversing Commands
.Nm
commands can be reversed in the following ways:
.Bl -dash
.It
Any affirmative commands that do not contain
.Ic enable
keyword can be reversed
with the
.Ic no
keyword in front of the affirmative version of the command.
e.g. reverse allowing IP packet forwarding.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nsh(config-p)/ip forwarding
nsh(config-p)/no ip forwarding
.Ed
.It
Any affirmative commands that contain
.Ic enable
keyword can be reversed
with
.Ic disable
keyword.
E.g reverse enabling packet filter firewall command.

.Ed
.El
.Ss Standard Prompt vs Privileged Prompt vs Configuration mode Prompt
.Tg disable
.Tg unprivileged
.Tg shell
.Ic Standard Prompt
The shell starts out with an unprivileged prompt which displays as the text
of the FQDN (fully qualified domain name) of the machine followed by a
forward slash.
This unprivileged prompt will allow only basic diagnostic commands
and does not allow viewing sensitive configuration information.
.Bl -dash
.It
e.g. standard prompt of the device firewall.machine.com
.Bd -literal -offset indent
firewall.machinename.com/
.Ed
.El
.Pp
.Tg enable
.Tg privileged
.Tg shell
.Ic Privileged Prompt
The privileged shell is accessed using the
.Cm enable
command.
It allows the administrator to run privileged diagnostic commands.
If external commands are enabled, external commands can be invoked by
the user in privileged mode.
The privileged mode alone will not allow changes to the system via
.Nm
commands.
The privileged shell is indicated by the FQDN of the machine followed
by (p) and followed by a /
.Bl -dash
.It
E.g. privileged shell prompt of the device firewall.machine.com
.Bd -literal -offset indent
firewall.machinename.com(p)/
.Ed
.El
.Pp
.Tg configure
.Tg config
.Ic Configuration Mode Prompt
The
.Cm configure
command allows the administrator to make changes to the system
configuration.
This additional command is a safeguard against accidental configuration
of a system.
I.e. a user can run privileged diagnostic commands, however without
configuration mode being enabled,
.Nm
will not permit any modifications to the system configuration.
.Pp
E.g. user elevating privileges from privilege disabled, to enabled privilege
mode and finally configuration mode on a system called hostname.nsh.org
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% NSH v1.1

.It
"Interface is up" means that the interface is turned on in software.
"Protocol is up" means that the interface is configured and ready to run.
The "Interface type" explains what the interface is used for on
the system.
Some interfaces are not intended to pass traffic for network users, and instead
handle internal functions on the system.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for more information on interface types supported by
.Ox .
.It
"Internet address" shows the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses configured for the
interface, if any.
IPv6 addresses with a % sign are "link-local" and not valid outside of the
context of the interface name specified.
MTU describes the Maximum Transmission Unit, the largest size of a packet which
the kernel can transmit on this interface.
.It
The statistics show the number of packets, bytes, errors, and dropped packets
in both incoming and outgoing directions.
The average input/output sizes describe the median size of packets going in
and out the interface.
Note that the total bytes in and/or out may not be accurate.
.Ox
uses an unsigned long type to hold the byte count.
When the byte count exceeds the storage limit of an unsigned long
(4,294,967,295 on a 32 bit architecture or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
on a 64-bit architecture), the counter will overflow, causing it to roll over
to 0.
The average packet size is inaccurate when the total byte count rolls
over, because the total number of packets reflects bytes that are no
longer counted.
.It
With verbose mode enabled, 'show interface' displays the raw kernel flags
for an interface.
See
.Xr ifmedia 4
for an explanation of these flags.

.Pp
Sets the timeout (seconds) for ARP entries to remain in cache on this system.
.Pp
When the system stops receiving ARP packets from the host and, the

seconds pass, the arp entries are removed from the ARP cache.
If a service or user requests to communicate with the IP address of the
removed cache entry the system requests via broadcast an ARP request.
Lower
.Ic arptimeout
values increase the broadcast traffic on the underlying network.
While higher

values increase the time it takes to resolve a host.

timeout on an intermediate bridge.

The TTL, or time-to-live, is decremented by one each time the packet passes
through another router on the internet.
The default TTL that the system uses is 64, therefore it allows for the
packet to pass through up to 64 routers (also called hops) before reaching
its destination.
The main purpose of the TTL is to avoid routing loops in the network.

The default priority of an interface is 0, except for IEEE 802.11 wireless
interfaces (priority 4), umb(4) interfaces (priority 6), and carp(4)
interfaces (priority 15).
The default priority of newly connected routes (routes created by
configuring an IP address on an interface) is calculated by adding 4
(RTP_CONNECTED) to the interface priority.
The default priority of new static routes added to the kernel is calculated
by adding 8 (RTP_STATIC) to the interface priority.

Note that the pfsync protocol currently includes no authentication method.
It is advisable to layer authentication, signing and (possibly encrypted
tunnels for the underlay interfaces.
For simplicity on co-located pfsynced firewalls a secure way to use pfsync,
is through a a direct (layer1 (i.e. no switches)) cable connecting directly
between two pfsync capable devices (i.e. a conenction made with an ethernet
patch cable).
This command is valid only for

Note: IP balancing is being used on a firewall, it is recommended to
configure the carpnodes in a symmetrical manner.
This is achieved by simply using the same carpnodes list on all sides of the

the standardised IPFIX (10).
.Pp
The pflow interface attempts aggregate multiple pflow records in one
export UDP packet.
The aggregation algoritim record for longer than 30 seconds.
The packet size and thus the maximum number of flows is controlled by the
mtu of the inteface the flows are exported via.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between packets seen by bpf(4) on
the pflow interface and packets sent out to the flow receiver.
I.e. if a packet with 30 flows on pflow, then the same 30 flows were sent out
to the receiver.

These interface names start with 'pflog'.
.Pp
IPsec Loopback: This interface is used internally in the system to
pass decapsulated IPsec traffic.
All traffic from this interface has already been authenticated and
unencrypted from the IPsec subsystem.
This is useful when writing firewall rules.
These interface names start with 'enc'.
.Pp
Generic Tunnel: This interface is used to configure a network tunnel to
another host or router.
It follows the RFC1933 tunnelling standard.
These interface names start with 'gif'.
.Pp
Ethernet Bridge: This interface is used to configure layer 2 bridging
between physical and virtual network ports on a system.
These interface names start with 'bridge'.
.Pp
Ethernet: This is a physical Ethernet interface, running at 10, 100, or
1000 megabits per second.
These interface names are based on the name of the driver, and vary with
different Ethernet chip types.
.Pp
IEEE 802.1Q Virtual: This is a virtual Ethernet, Token Ring, or FDDI
interface.
It uses the IEEE 802.1Q protocol to segment real Ethernet interfaces into
multiple layer 2 networks.
These interface names start with 'vlan'.
.Pp
Virtual: This is a virtual interface of any type.
Often several different interfaces use this type.
Several versions of
.Ox
use this type to denote virtual IEEE 802.1Q interfaces, described above.
.Pp
PPP: This interface implements the Point to Point Protocol (PPP).
PPP, described in RFC 1661, creates a network over serial communication lines.
It is used over modem connections, direct serial links, leased lines, and
over virtual IP based connections such as in SSH sessions.
These interface names start with 'ppp' when referring to a version which
supports serial and modem connections.
Other interface types may also implement the Point to Point Protocol.
.Pp
IEEE 802.11 Wireless: This interface implements the IEEE 802.11 wireless
LAN protocol.
Many implementations of this network have little or no security unless used
with proper encryption such as IPsec.
These interface names are based on the name of the driver, and vary with
different wireless chip types.
