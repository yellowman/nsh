nsh is a work in progress, future versions will be released which
implement much of the following (of course, diffs are welcome):

Cleanup:

* Formatting for the manual.  Something that looks slick in PDF and print.
* Restructure, rewrite a few things, etc..
* Check more errno values in various places for common mistakes and print out
  the error in "plain english" instead of kernel/library jargon
* More security auditing for string handling, off-by-one errors, data
  passed to kernel, data passed elsewhere...
* Maybe user args should be set to lowercase at early so that we dont have to
  use strcasecmp/strncasecmp everywhere?
* User args should be sanity checked early for interference
* Consistency in how we perror() for commands called from interface(),
  give user-friendly messages, as these errors generally represent user
  error (but not from perror in conf() or other things that are not called
  direct from CLI as these errors generally represent problems in nsh)
* Consistency in how errors are returned, handled

To be implemented:

* Ask for a password when user requests enable
* View other users logged in, clear their sessions, etc...
* IPsec! Configure VPNs with simple CLI commands-isakmpd has a fifo interface
* IPComp...
* DHCP daemon control
* Do we build in a simple ping, traceroute or just shell out for these??
* And what about telnet/ssh (maybe shell out for ssh, implement a simple
  telnet?)

Lower priority:

* BGP, OSPF?? Hooks to integrate zebra(GPL)/gated(BSDlic)/mrtd(BSDlic)/???
* IPv6?? (shouldn't be hard, considering that most of the functions
  we stole from other source already support it)
* IPIP/GRE?? Other tunnels??
* IPX?? AppleTalk??

Would be nice:

* Perhaps some way for the shell to upgrade itself, or the entire system/
  flash image when given a network source for new binaries?
* Build a web interface that works through the rc file handler
* Turn pfctl into a library and use it directly
* Add more diagnostic messages for verbose output where useful
* Can we hook into snmpd at all or just run it separately on the same box?
* Support for paging through displays of text X lines at a time
* Something comparable to "| inc" from cisco-land
* Tab command/argument completion
* Context-sensitive help
* Import unimplemented wicontrol features
* And what about sbecontrol?
* Convenient/automatic mechanisms to centralize configurations for
  tracking/revision control
* Get rid of routepr.c and use sysctl-based functions instead while still
  displaying all that tasty info
* While there, split out arp/route show

Known Bugs (or, things that I don't want to bother with right now, but
better not forget later...):

* 'nwid ""' will cause a card in access point mode to freak out.  (Although,
  lots of things seem to cause Prism cards in AP mode to freak out.  Apparently
  these problems are due to the if_wi driver not properly checking and dealing
  with error returns)
* The 3.2 kernel does not keep count of information displayed in 'show rtstat'
  properly (what else??)
* We need to mask the rounding error for altq tbr 'rate' value

  The error can be demonstrated with the test program at
  ftp://nmedia.net/pub/nsh/tbrtest.c

  From Kenjiro Cho:
  "The rate is scaled by the clock frequency within the kernel.
  So, you see a rounding error when you set and get the rate.  

  When you set the rate, the internal rate is computed as:

        u_int64_t internal_rate = ((rate / 8) << 32) / clock_freq;

  When you get the rate, the rate is re-computed as:

        u_int rate = (internal_rate * 8 * clock_freq) >> 32;
 
  One way to mask the rounding error is to convert the value to a
  floating value, round off the mantissa, and convert it back to an
  integer."
