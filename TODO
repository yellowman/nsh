$nsh: TODO,v 1.21 2007/12/17 09:20:53 chris Exp $

nsh is a work in progress, future versions will be released which
implement much of the following (of course, diffs are welcome):

Cleanup:

* Formatting for the manual.  Something that looks slick in PDF and print.
* Check more errno values in various places for common mistakes and print out
  the error in "plain english" instead of kernel/library jargon
* More security auditing for string handling, off-by-one errors, data
  passed to kernel, data passed elsewhere...
* Maybe user args should be set to lowercase at early so that we dont have to
  use strcasecmp/strncasecmp everywhere?
* User args should be sanity checked early on
* Consistency in how we print errors for commands called from interface(),
  give user-friendly messages, as these errors generally represent user
  error (whereas an error in conf() or other things that are not called
  direct from CLI generally represent problems in nsh, or strange user
  alterations of the conf file)
* Consistency in how errors are returned, handled between functions
* Get rid of wi crap, move to new interfaces where necessary
* Do we need to implement different get_lladdr for ieee80211 interfaces?
  Test this

To be implemented:

* fix arp set/show
* handle multipath routes
* pfsync syncpeer
* snmpd access controls or snmpd.conf edit
* bridge rtsp commands
* Rest of newer 802.11 gunk like rssi display, chan, flags
* kernel pppoe
* handle TDM timeslots
* View other users logged in, clear their sessions, etc...
* Interface with bgpd.conf, ospfd.conf, ripd.conf, relayd.conf and associated
  ctl programs, maybe like we do with pf.conf and pfctl
* Configure IPsec VPNs/IPComp with simple CLI commands (The easiest way to do
  this would be through ipsecctl?? or direct?)
* DHCP daemon control
* exec ssh/telnet
* Persistent comments/remarks in the config file (to document routes, etc..)
* IPv6 (shouldn't be too hard, considering that most of the functions
  we stole from other source already support it, but i won't look at this
  until I use IPv6 myself, or someone else submits IPv6 patches)

Would be nice:

* Perhaps some way for the shell to upgrade itself, or the entire system/
  flash image when given a network source for new binaries?
* Build a simple web interface that works through the rc file handler (web if
  that calls nsh -i to execute commands)
* Turn pfctl into a library and use it directly
* Separate the user interface from the kernel interface so that nsh doesn't
  need to be run as root.  Maybe use an nsh daemon in the background that could
  persistently keep other information not stored in the kernel itself.  The
  daemon approach might be nice for a web app to access the back end of nsh.
  Or, use the imsg framework.
* Add more diagnostic messages for verbose output where useful
* Support for paging through displays of text X lines at a time
* Something comparable to "| inc" from cisco-land
* Tab command/argument completion
* Context-sensitive help
* Convenient/automatic mechanisms to centralize configurations for
  tracking/revision control
* Get rid of routepr.c and use sysctl-based functions instead while still
  displaying all that tasty info
* Do the same thing for the various IP statistics that are now sysctl-able
* While there, split out arp/route show

Known Bugs (or, things that I don't want to bother with right now, but
better not forget later...):

* The kernel does not keep count of information displayed in 'show rtstat'
  properly (what else??)
* ALTQTBRSET was removed from the kernel with the migration to pf.  But,
  there is no easy to use equivalent.  Fix this.
* ...
